</ol>

>**Custom Features**:

    <li>Added a 'Magic Ball' to give PacMan something to do</li>
    <li>User can score points with each 'Magic Ball' collision</li>
    <li>'Magic Ball' behavior may change depending on 'contact time'</li>
    <li>Mouse, keyboard, and mobile touch controls</li>
    <li>Reload button</li>
    <li>Mini-game is fully responsive using custom CSS and JavaScript</li>
</ol>
